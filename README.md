# Screenshots
after completing the step by step guide in the lab 1 and adding the ssh key to github,
I went to my GitHub repository and found my new branch under the “Branches” section.
I clicked the "Compare & pull request" button.
I wrote a short description of the changes I made.
I clicked "Create pull request."
My classmate reviewed my changes. If he needed me to fix anything, he left comments, and I updated my branch accordingly.
Once everything was good, he merged my pull request into the main project and if updates were made to the branch i clicked update branch
That was my first pull request experience
